Since most of the older set began in about 2010, there is an eight-year industry evolution that takes place in terms of equipment, design practice, developers, and locale. The most notable shift over the eight years between these samples is the inverter loading ratio, or ILR, often equivalently called the dc:ac ratio. In the older set, the median and average ILRs were 1.12 and 1.18, respectively. With ILRs this low, there is very little energy sacrificed due to clipping in this older set of 100. It is nearly negligible. However, in the newer set, the median ILR of 1.33 and the average ILR of 1.25 suggest the typical clipping loss for the newer systems has been in excess of 2% per year.
